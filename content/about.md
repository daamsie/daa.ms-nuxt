Let me introduce myself.

I'm Peter, a self-taught full-stack web developer, keen gardener, artist and father of two.

I was born in the Solomon Islands, spent my high school years in the Netherlands and have lived in Melbourne, Australia since 1998.

In the early 2000s I was working as a video editor when I discovered web development. In my spare time, I created a website to help people reconnect with people they had met on their travels.
A "Friends Reunited for Travel" you might call it. Ultimately, that morphed into a blogging platform, travel forum and trip mapping system that over a million members have signed up to since its inception. 

That site is Travellerspoint.

Since then I have also branched out to work on several other projects. I have worked on various popular travel websites: I Want That Flight; I Know The Pilot; and Travel Massive. I have also written several Wordpress plugins for WP Charitable - a popular suite of charity fundraising plugins. More details on these projects can be found in this portfolio.

My favourite part of developing websites is ensuring the user experience is as simple as possible for users. Form should follow function. I take great satisfaction in creating an interface that feels intuitive and simple while also being attractive.

I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks, and particularly enjoy working in Javascript. I continually strive to learn new skills, languages through reading, podcasts and of course by programming. 

Aside from getting stuck into code, I also enjoy gardening, drawing and painting. I've added a short section with some of my art.
