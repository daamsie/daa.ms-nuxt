Let me introduce myself.

I'm Peter, a self-taught full-stack web developer, keen gardener, artist and father of two.

I was born in the Solomon Islands, spent my high school years in the Netherlands and have lived in Melbourne, Australia since 1998.

In the early 2000s I was working as a video editor when I discovered web development. In my spare time, I created a website to help people reconnect with people they had met on their travels.
A "Friends Reunited for travel" you might call it. Ultimately, that morphed into a blogging platform, travel forum and trip mapping system that over a million members have signed up to. It became popular enough that I was able to work on it full time for many years.

That site is Travellerspoint.

Since then I have also branched out to work on several other projects. I have worked on various websites, including popular travel websites I Want That Flight, I Know The Pilot and Travel Massive. I have also written several Wordpress plugins for Charitable - a popular suite of charity fundraising plugins.  

My favourite part of creating websites is ensuring the user experience is as simple as possible for users. Function over form.

I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks, and particularly enjoy working in Javascript.

Aside from getting stuck into code, I also enjoy gardening, drawing and painting. I've added a short section with some of my art.
