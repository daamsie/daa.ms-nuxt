[Travel Massive](https://travelmassive.com/) is a large community of travel industry professionals. I helped at various stages of a redevelopment from 2020 to 2022. 

Initially I worked over a couple of weeks closely with the founder, Ian, on a prototype built in Vue.js. 

The decision was eventually made to use the Phoenix framework and I helped with various aspects of this, learning Elixir along the way.

Among other things, I developed a CMS for any of the various landing pages needed on the site. It allows easy adding of Tailwind styled HTML to the site including some reusable blocks to reduce duplication. 

I also did a lot of work on the UX of the site.
