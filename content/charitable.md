[WP Charitable](https://www.wpcharitable.com/) is a popular Wordpress plugin built to help non-profits with their online fundraising efforts. 

I helped with various projects on WP Charitable over a 2 year period. Some of the highlights include:

* Developing a plugin integrating WP Charitable with Square
* Developing a plugin integrating WP Charitable with WooCommerce
* A redevelopment of the payment UX to allow more flexible use of different payment gateways
* Developing a plugin to allow tips to be added to donations. 
* Developing a plugin to integrate Charitable with Payrexx
