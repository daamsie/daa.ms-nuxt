Since 2002, [Travellerspoint](https://www.travellerspoint.com) has been one of the web's most enduring travel communities. A popular forum, blogging platform and mapping system keep attracting new travellers to the platform. The site counts over a million members. 

The backend is a combination of Lucee (*an open source version of ColdFusion*), NodeJS, Elasticsearch, AWS Lambda, MariaDB and Redis. 

The front end utilises Vue for the more complex areas (eg.. the mapping tool). I learned a lot about creating scalable websites, keeping users happy and the many challenges faced when launching a new product.
