[I Want That Flight](https://iwantthatflight.com.au/) is a popular flight meta search engine largely targetted at the Australian market. 

I have worked on a freelance basis on various parts of the website since 2017. Some of the things I've worked on over this time include

* A full revamp of the front end to ensure the design was responsive and attractive to a modern audience.
* Chrome extensions to help with finding flight deals
* An admin interface to assist with sending out daily flight deal summary emails
* Developing a flight search widget for use by affiliate partners
* Adjusting the site to allow for white labeling by affiliates
