[I Know The Pilot](https://iknowthepilot.com.au/) is Australia's favourite flight deals site. Every day new deals are sent out to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. 

I have helped develop this site in numerous ways. 

* Designed and implemented the web front end (.NET, CSS, JS)
* Built a standalone API that handles the sending of emails to the subscribers (.NET)
* Created a dashboard to monitor campaign progress (Vue.js). 
* Designed Email templates for deals (HTML, CSS)
